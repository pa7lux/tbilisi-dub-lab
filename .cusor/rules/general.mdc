# General rules
- use Nuxt for frontend
- use CSS, no tailwind
- add all key updates during the development of the app to creation-log.md file
- keep all rules for agents aligned in general.mdc, .cursorrules and claude.md files
- use English or Georgian in website UI. No any other languages allowed
- Use English only to make comments in the code

# Content Management
- **All user-facing text** must use i18n (i18n/locales/en.json, i18n/locales/ka.json)
- Never hardcode user-facing text in components - always use `$t()` for translations
- This includes: buttons, labels, navigation, paragraphs, titles, everything
- Keep all translations in sync between en.json and ka.json

# CSS Styles
- **All sizes and colors** must be defined as CSS variables at the top of component styles
- Variables should be scoped to the component (inside component's root class)
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `--btn-padding`, `--title-color`, `--content-gap`)
- Group related variables together (spacing, colors, sizes, transitions, etc.)
- Apply variables in actual styles below the variable declarations
